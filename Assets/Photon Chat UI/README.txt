Photon Chat UI offers you an easy way to add a nice looking chat system to your game with Photon Chat (a separate product). 
By dragging a single prefab into the scene, you are adding a complex chat module which features:
  - multi-tab channel docks
  - floating windows for channels - allowing a user to place the conversation window wherever he likes
  - support for emoticons (set of Emoji emoticons included in the package)
  - support for private messages
  - integration with the Photon Network (giving a possibility to log the user in automatically if he or she is already signed in to the game)
All of the mentioned features can be customized. You can find more information in the documentation.
This kit ships with fully documented source-code - you can modify it anyway you like.


Demo Setup
  On the Chat Dasboard (link below), you will find your Chat "App Id". 
  Copy and paste your App ID into the "Chat" Object in the hierarchy.

  This UI Kit uses Photon Chat as networking service. You will need an account to setup a Chat Application.
  Registration and a basic Chat Application are free and without obligation.
