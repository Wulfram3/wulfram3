PDG Lunar Terrain Bonus Pack
----------------------------

Overview:
This asset contains additional textures for your PDG Lunar Terrain asset.


Detail Textures
---------------
One example set of three different, tiling textures, see folder "Detail Textures"
They are intended to work as detailed ground-cover and could be painted on the terrain
manually or automatically (via splatmaps)


Splatmaps
---------
The "Splatmaps" folder contains 15 splatmaps, matching the topology of the lunar terrains.
They can be used to automatically control the distribution of detail textures.


Diffuse Textures
----------------
The diffuse textures in this package got no Ambient Occlusion "baked" into their RGB channels
, instead the AO was put into the Alpha Channel. This textures are best to
use with the Marmoset Skyshop Terrain Shader, but can also be used with standard
unity shaders. Just give them a try and see, which suits you best!

For further and more detailed informations, please see the "PDG Lunar Terrain Manual v1.1"
.pdf document inside the main package!
